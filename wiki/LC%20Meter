An Arduino shield for measuring inductance, capacitance, and frequency. The initial plans do not include a display, the measured value will be reported over a serial link.

The concept is based on the [[http://www.kerrywong.com/2010/10/16/avr-lc-meter-with-frequency-measurement/|AVR LC Meter]] by [[http://www.kerrywong.com/about/|Kerry Wong]]. My contributions will be:

* Turn the design into a shield PCB for the Arduino Uno.
* Modify the code for serial output only.
* Add documentation to the code with explanations I find helpful.
* Simulate the circuit with {{{ngspice}}}
* Put it all together in a [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/|Mercurial]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control|DRCS]] with an eye towards hosting it at [[http://code.google.com/hosting/|Google Code]]

A sub-goal is that I want to be able to do the work on multiple computers, both on and off-line, so that I can take advantage of my //spare time//.
