An Arduino shield for measuring inductance, capacitance, and frequency. The initial plans do not include a display, the measured value will be reported over a serial link.

The concept is based on the [[http://www.kerrywong.com/2010/10/16/avr-lc-meter-with-frequency-measurement/|AVR LC Meter]] by [[http://www.kerrywong.com/about/|Kerry Wong]]. My contributions will be:

* Turn the design into a shield PCB for the Arduino Uno.
* Modify the code for serial output only.
* Add documentation to the code with explanations I find helpful.
* Simulate the circuit with {{{ngspice}}}
