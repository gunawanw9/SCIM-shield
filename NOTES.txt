  New project: Design and build a Arduino based LC Meter
    - use gEDA tools
    - use mercurial for the DRCS
    - use Hatta for the wiki
  
  Install Hatta:
    - INSTALL: mercurial python-werkzeug python-pygments
    - Downloaded hatta.py from the website (http://hatta-wiki.org). Put
      it in my ~/bin directory.

  Create initial repository in the /srv directory on raven.
  Clone a local copy:
    hg clone ssh://jerry@raven//srv/hg/lcMeter

    - Start the wiki by running 'hatta.py'
    - Wiki will be at http://localhost:8080/
    - The hatta.conf file is set to constrain access to localhost.

    TODO:
      - finish UI schematic - DONE
      - add power connections to schematics - DONE
      - footprints for:
         - LCD
         - Terminals
         - BNC
         - Switches

    - DONE: Rework Uno connector symbols- confusing pin label/number positions
      when symbol is inverted/rotated

Sun 26 Jun 2011 09:59:22 PM PDT
    - DONE: Calculate pull-up resistors for level shifter per 2.3.5 of
      AN10418.

        10K will work for bus capacitance up to 200pF, even with 3.3v
        levels.
