# lcMeter - an Arduino Shield for measuring L,C, and F

Now using git, but a remote repository has not been setup (as of
2014/02/15)

See the hdwr/Notes.txt file for more design notes. Also check the commit
history.

The `scrapbook/` directory has hyperlinks related to this project.
It requires the Firefox Scrapbook plugin.

There is also an associated project wiki in the `wiki/` directory. It is
driven by hatta.py (see the first couple of notes below usage info).

_WARNING_: Hatta Wiki requires mercurial, so the wiki is broken now that
           the repository has been moved to `git`. The pages can be
           displayed but `Edit` and `History` do not work.

The design evolved to have an LCD display, but that was then dropped
while trying to layout the PCB due to space problems. Only the NUI (No
User Interface) version has been routed.

# Project Setup
On Ubuntu the design tools can be installed with this command:

    $ sudo apt-get install geda geda-doc geda-examples geda-utils gerbv ngspice ngspice-doc pcb make make-doc

The _-doc_ packages are optional.

    - use gEDA tools
    - use mercurial for the DRCS
    - use Hatta for the wiki
  
  Install Hatta:
    - INSTALL: mercurial python-werkzeug python-pygments
    - Downloaded hatta.py from the website (http://hatta-wiki.org). Put
      it in my ~/bin directory.

        levels.

    - Schematics are complete. Committing.

##Wed 29 Jun 2011 11:18:40 PM PDT
    - Running gnetlist -g drc2 against all of the schematics at once
      generates a bunch of duplicate refdes errors, but I thought the
      reference designators were necessary to make the connection
      between levels... Maybe drc2 should not be run against a
      hierarchical design, but only against multiple page designs, or
      one page at a time for hierarchical.

    - I did not correct the warnings about missing pintype attribute for
      the I/O devices in the subckrt schematics.

    - I'm ignoring the error with respect to open-collectors. There is a
      patch pending that would eliminate the error.

    - Installed gspiceui to check it out

##Sun 03 Jul 2011 09:26:46 PM PDT
    - Found that gspiceui is part of the problem.
      When the + input to the LM393 was a named net, gspiceui would drop
      it LM393 from the simulation list created by gspiceui.

      The netlist created by gnetlist doesn't have the problem.

    - spice_capMeter.sch can now be simulate by ngspice. I had to add a
      pullup resistor to the output of the frequency buffer and and a
      10uf capacitor to the input in order to slow down the oscillator
      frequency. Otherwise I got error messages about the time interval
      being two small.

##Sun 03 Jul 2011 11:11:52 PM PDT
    - The spice simulations are showing a little oscillation on the +5v
      levels of the osc output and even larger oscillations on the
      output of the frequency buffer. Adding 10pf to the output of each
      module seems to help. Adding 100pf causes a bit of rounding to the
      top of the rising edge.

    TODO:
      - Move R222 to the outside of freq_buf - DONE
      - R223, needs a different number (R7) - DONE, R7
      - The simulation fails if R223 is 10K but works if it is 100k.
        This sets the historesis, so check the buffer stand-alone to see
        how big the input signal needs to be. - FIXED by changing the
        .TRANS simulation command to includ 'UIC' (Use initial conditions).
      - I think the highest frequency occurs when there is no capacitor
        and no inductor. Verify this. Yes. DONE
      - Determine the highest frequency that can be passed by the
        freq_buf. This will set the highest input frequency. DONE - see
        below.

      - Clean-up schematics- DONE
      - Add .TRANS directives to the spice_* schematics rather than
        relying on the external, and common, spicecmds file. - DONE
      - Create separate spice_* schematics for inductance and frequency
        measurements.
      - Clarify the Lx/Cx labels - DONE (switched them)


##Mon 04 Jul 2011 10:02:58 AM PDT
    - Found that adding 10pf to the output of the freq_osc would
      eliminate the HF oscillation at the top of the output waveform.
      1pf would cause overshoot, 100pf would cause noticable rounding of
      the corners of the waveform.

##Mon 04 Jul 2011 12:42:18 PM PDT
    - Web search provided more information on the "doAnalyses: TRAN:
      Timestep too small" error message. I found I could fix the problem
      by adding a UIC (use initial conditions) to the .TRAN directive.
      That let me put R7 back to 10k and use 50k for the pull-up (which
      is the pullup listed for I/O pins in the Atmega data sheet.


##Mon 04 Jul 2011 02:21:53 PM PDT
    - With R7 at 10k and the pull-up resistor at 50k, there is roll-off on
      the rising edge.
    - Added a pull-up resistor to the freq_buf, R10. 3.3K. Also changed
      the feedback resistor, R7, to 100K, so that the high side of the
      wave form would be closer to 5v. (4.9 vs 4.5 volts).

    - The sink current for the output of the comparitor will be
      5/(1/(1/3.3k + 1/50K + 1/(100K + 10K))) = 1.67mA. This is well
      within the 20mA spec for the LM393.


##Sun 17 Jul 2011 09:02:07 AM PDT
    - After spending quite a bit of time, I am unable to get a ngspice
      simulation to work with the frequence measurement configuration
      due to the clipping diodes. Without the diodes an AC analysis can
      be run and roll-off is seen well above 1MHz. I suspect that I am
      not getting the diodes biased properly at the start of the AC
      simulation. So for now I am dropping the diodes in the spice
      frequency model.


##Sun 17 Jul 2011 10:23:28 AM PDT
    - Spice simulation of the frequency meter shows that the 3db point
      is at about 9.7MHz. This 'cut-off' frequency is primarily due to
      the 10pf input load. Even so, the effective frequency range may be
      much larger because of the high gain of the comparator may yield
      a large enough voltage swing to trigger the edge detection used
      for counting.


##Sun 17 Jul 2011 10:37:11 AM PDT
    - Changed R7 back to 10K because I found got the .TRANS simulations
      to work using the UIC (Use Initial Contitions) flag.
    - Recalculated the cut-off frequency which is now about 26MHz


##Sun 17 Jul 2011 10:18:28 PM PDT
    - Found the problem with the diode modeling- the capacitance value
      in the model did not have a units symbol. So it was 30 farads(!)
      not 30pF.
    - Now both AC and TRAN analysis can be run on spice_freqMeter.sch
      and spice_freqMeter.sch includes the diodes.
    - I couldn't find a ways to run both the AC and the TRAN analysis
      without modifying the SPICE directives and the V2 definition. So
      follow the notes in the file.

    TODO: run TRAN analysis at higher frequencies and evaluate diodes
    TODO: select a diode and put in a better model.
    Diodes Inc has a good selection of spice models.

##Mon 18 Jul 2011 09:33:26 PM PDT
    - Setup attribs file for BOM/BOM2
    - now I can easily see which items need a footprint
    - for things like switches, I'm going to set the value to none or the vendor
      part number, that way there will be no 'unknown' values in the BOM
      listing when the design is complete.

    - Current limiting resistor R11
      The spec for the LED back light is 3.0v, at 15mA (20mA max)
      The spec for the Atmel output pins is 0.9v max at 20mA
      There really isn't a resistor that will work for the full range of
      max/min values of power supply and Vout from the pin. See
      R11_LED_Calcs.ods. If the power supply is limited to 4.75-5.25v,
      then a 56 ohm 1% is pretty close. The 5.25v cases exceed the
      max current spec on the LED, but I don't know that 20mA is really
      the 'max' current that the LED can handle, or if it is the max
      minimum-voltage required to fully light the LED. If the later then
      the problem would be the 4.75/0.9 case.

    - Changed from mecurial (hg) to git because I am using git on a
      daily basis.
        - used git-hg from https://github.com/offbytwo/git-hg
        - work was done on sony-SVE14A1HFXB
        - git-hg was removed after use
    - The mercurial repository on `raven.local.dunmire.org` need to be
      marked as obsolete.
