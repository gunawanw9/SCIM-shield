elements directory for pcb must have sub directory and footprints
(elements) go in the sub directories.

PCB layouts are not PCB 'elements' (footprints), though PCB can be used
to create and new element.

The shield_outline.pcb seems to be intended as the starting point for a
layout PCB file and not a footprint.

The 'problem' I have is that the shield_outline.sch file does not have
names associated with the connectors and the pins on the connectors.

Perhaps I should create individual schematic components for each
connector and then the footprint stays the same as specified in the
existing shield_outline.sch.

I also wonder if the reference designators can be 'fixed', perhaps by
using names like Power, IO_H, IO_L, and AIO instead of J1-4
  - need to see what happens when the program to number devices is run.

Setting the newlib path for pcb:
  - library-newlib = ...:...:...
       works in ~/.pcb/preferences and adds to the default list
       does not work in ./pcb.settings

  - lib-newlib = ...:...:...
       works in pcb.settings, but overrides the default list.
       So to get the defaults you must include
       "/usr/share/pcb/newlib:/usr/share/pcb/pcblib-newlib

  NOTE: the directories listed in library-newlib and/or lib-newlib will
        not appear in the library until they have a subdirectory. Only
        elements in the subdirectories will be listed in the library

    - Reference designators can be specified in the symbol
    - Reference designators without a number will get numbered when
      refdes_renum is run. So IOH becomes IOH1
    - I've created separate symbols for each of the four connectors on
      the UNO layout with reference designators already assigned.
    - If the schematics do not include all four connectors then when gsch2pcb
      is run it will delete connectors from the .pcb file that are not
      found on the schematics!

    The shield_outline.pcb includes a netlist section, but I don't think
    it is needed.

    TODO: set a rocking-d symbol on the shield as my 'brand'
      - fix reference designator names for the UNO connectors in the
          symbol files. Use J1-4 and not IOH, IOL, etc. - DONE
      - delete netlist from shield_outline.pcb - DONE
      - add missing hole to the shield - DONE
      - set a version number on the shield - DONE
      - set a copyright/license notice on the shield - DONE
      - reconsider names for the shield connect symbol file names. -
        DONE

    Instructions for using shield_outline.pcb
      - create schematic with all four symbols for the connectors
      - run refdes_renum (or set ref designators by hand)
      - copy templates/shield_outline.pcb to the new board name
      - setup .prj file (make new-board-name.prj and then edit to add
          the full list of schematics.
      - run gsch2pcb and follow instructions

      - general instructions on how to setup .prj:
          - specifiy output-name
          - specify elements-dir
          - list all the schematics on the 'schematics' line.

          There is a pattern rule in the Makefile (%.prj:) that will
          create an initial .prj file. After running 'make
          new-board.prj' don't forget to edit the new-board.prj file and
          add additional schematics as needed.

    - After running refdes_renum on all the schematics, the reference
      designators for the I/O pins in the sub-circuits were assigned
      numbers. This then caused an error when the DRC was run.

    - For the 1uF capacitors use a CK05 footprint. The pin spacing is
      0.200 inches which should also work for many ceramic dipped which
      have lead spacing of 0.197 inches

    - Added bypass caps for the level shifter. 0.1 uF
    
    - The 1000pF precision cap has a lead spacing of 0.343",
      pin-dia=0.032". There is a lower voltage version, at a higher cost
      from Digikey, with a closer pin spacing: 0.234, pin dia = 0.025".

    - Change C1 and C2 to ceramic. That eliminates the plolarity, but
      the tolerance is -20%/+80%. I don't think this tolerance range
      will have an effect on the operation, but I should check with
      spice. The lead spacing would be 0.197" (5mm), pin dia = 0.5mm
      (0.019")

      TODO: check C1/C2 tolerance

    - Results of spice analysis of C1/C2 tolerance.
      I found that for large values of the test capacitor, the
      difference in values between C1/C2 impacts the oscillator startup.
      If C2 is 11uf and C1 is 9uf (+10%/-10%) then the oscillator does
      not start if the test cap is 10uf or above. If the mismatch is 2%
      then the test capacitor could be up to 50uf.

      So the tolerance does matter.

    - 10uF cap options:
      Ceramic
        FK24Y5V1A106Z, (4.5mm, 5mm,0.5mm ) 0.177 ,0.197, -.0197
        There is an FK1x series that would that has a pin spacing of
        2.5mm (0.100") which would be a better matched to the other
        capacitor alternatives.
